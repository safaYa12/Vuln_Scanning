# 🔍 Internship Task 3: Full Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

This repository documents my third task during my cybersecurity internship, which focused on setting up and performing a complete vulnerability scan using **OpenVAS** or **Nessus Essentials**.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

1. Install **OpenVAS** or **Nessus Essentials** in a local lab environment.
2. Configure the scan target using my local machine IP or localhost.
3. Launch a **full vulnerability scan** covering all reachable services and ports.
4. Wait for the scan to finish (typically 30–60 minutes).
5. Review the vulnerability report to analyze risk levels and severity.
6. Research recommended fixes or mitigations for discovered vulnerabilities.
7. Document the **most critical vulnerabilities**, their CVEs, and risk ratings.
8. Take and save **screenshots** of scan results for documentation and reporting.

## ✅ What I Learned

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: How to use automated scanners to detect open ports, running services, OS versions, and match them to known CVEs.
- **Risk Assessment**: How to interpret CVSS scores and prioritize remediation.
- **Remediation Research**: How to find and recommend practical fixes for common security flaws.
- **Reporting**: How to organize findings into clear, actionable documentation.
